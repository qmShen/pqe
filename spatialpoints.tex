\chapter{Mobility Based on Spatial Points}
\label{chap:intro}

In this section, we will introduce the mobility analytics based on spatial points. To make the spatial points different from the the other two modeling methods, here we will not track the movement of single movers. Under this modeling, the overall movement will be generated according to the comparison of the spatial distribution in different time range.
